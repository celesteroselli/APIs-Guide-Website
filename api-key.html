        <!--i'm not sure if this is right :skulk-->
        <p><u>NOTE</u>: please note that concealing an API key requires that you are using a framework rather than pure html/css/javascript. 
          If you attempt to use plain Javascript, you won't be able to use environmental variables and will instead have to hard-code your API key, 
          which poses a security risk if your codebase is public. So, <b>if your code is public</b> (ex. public on GitHub) <b>and you are using plain Javascript </b> (for example, if you followed the beginner website tutorial shared earlier), <b>then you should not call an API with an API key in your application. </b>
        </p>
        <p>Check out <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/nextjs_starter/" target="_blank">this guide</a> if you need to create a simple Astro template website to follow along. </p>
        <p>If you want to learn more about what an API key is, check out <a href="/info.html">this page</a>. </p>
        <p class="important">Another thing: unless you are paying for CatAPI usage, you don't need to use an API key. This guide walks through using one so that if you are using a paid API or one which requires a key, you can apply this same structure to that circumstance. </p>
        <p>Ok, let's get an API key! First, head over to <a href="https://thecatapi.com/">thecatapi.com</a>, and click "GET YOUR API KEY".</p>
        <img width="400" src="/images/catapi_get_api_key_screenshot.png">
        <p>It will then prompt you to choose between a free and a paid plan. You'll only need a free account, so select that option.</p>
        <img width="400" src="/images/catapi_get_free_access_screenshot.png">
        <p>Then, you'll have to create an account. Enter an email and write a short app name (mine was CatAPI tutorial)</p>
        <img width="200" src="/images/catapi_sign_up_screenshot.png">
        <p>After that, click submit and you'll be ready to go! You'll know that you're set when you see the message below: </p>
        <img width="300" src="/images/catapi_api_key_success.png">
        <p>After creating a CatAPI account, beneath the "Your API key has landed" message, there should have been a notice that you'll be receiving your API key via email. </p>
        <img width="400" src="images/catapi_api_key_in_email.png">
        <p>When you check your inbox, you should have an email that looks like the following: </p>
        <img width="400" src="images/catapi_api_key_email_in_inbox.png">
        <p>When you open your email, your api key will be in a grey box, on white text beneath the message "Here's your API key": </p>
        <img width="400" src="images/catapi_api_key_email.png">
        <p>Since its considered best practice (for security reasons, especially for paid keys!) to keep your API keys private (learn more about that <a href="/info.html">here</a>), I've blocked my API key with a red box. 
        <!--not sure if I want to include this-->In this case, since its not for a paid API (each usage doesn't charge you) and it doesn't access private data, I'm only really hiding it to follow that convention. </p>
        <p>Finally, copy this API key to your clipboard and make sure you keep this email! You may have to reference it later to copy your key again if your clipboard was overridden at some point. </p>
